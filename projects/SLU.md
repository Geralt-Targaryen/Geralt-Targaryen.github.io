summary: "Chinese Spoken Language Understanding with @<a href=\"https://github.com/KevinSRR\" target=\"_blank\">Reginald</a>. We formulated SLU as a sequence tagging task, and applied both discriminative token labeling models and seq2seq models to it. We also proposed a dual-branch decoder model to utilize manually corrected ASR transcriptions for denoising."
