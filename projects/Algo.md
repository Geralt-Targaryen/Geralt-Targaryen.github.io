summary: "Technically this was my first writing that's remotely \"academic\", but Iâ€™m not bothering myself to read it again &#129322;. For some reason I was obssessed with Genetic Algorithm at that time, without even realizing the existence of neural networks, gradient descent, or Python &#129313;."
